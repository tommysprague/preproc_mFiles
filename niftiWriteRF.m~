% niftiWriteRF.m
%
% writes params of an RF model, COMPUTED INPLANE!!!, to a nii file where
% each volume contains a different parameter; the first (0th) being the
% variance explained for thresholding. Readable by programs such as afni,
% fsl (not tested), BV (not tested), etc.
%
% RFmodel is a model structure saved by rmMain.m
% new_fn is the filename of the nii (extension .nii or .nii.gz)
% basenii is a nifti structure in the 'correct' orientation of the
% functional data used to create RF maps (e.g., load one of the averaged
% vols)
%
% NOTE: no support for sigma major/minor (assumes major), etc - really
% built for nonlinear models, but can be adjusted to deal w/ others...

% Tommy Sprague, 4/5/2017
% - 7/30/2017 - changed order b/w default phase & VE - afni defaults to
%   thresholding on 2nd dim. Also write out a new_fn_params.txt of order of
%   params saved, to be used by label_retmap.sh
